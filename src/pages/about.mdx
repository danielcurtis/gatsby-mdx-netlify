# About

## About this page

This page isn't reachable by Netlify CMS. It's a normal MDX page at the first 
level in the **`/src/pages`** directory. 

It's just normal markdown with the ability to import components.

## About this project

The "why" behind this project is because I wanted an easy, maintenance-free docs 
website for [Another C Library](https://anotherclibrary.com). All of the other 
Gatsby docs starters didn't support MDX or they were too opinionated. Then I 
stumbled upon the awesome [Gatsby-MDX Netlify CMS Starter](https://github.com/renvrant/gatsby-mdx-netlify-cms-starter) 
and built upon it.

**Contributions are welcome. Head on over to [GitHub](https://github.com/danielcurtis/gatsby-starter-netlify-docs) for more info.**
